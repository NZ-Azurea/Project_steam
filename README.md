Welcome to the Steam data analysis and generation project repository. This project is configured for easy deployment using Docker.

Quick Start

***warning:The project requires **45 GB** of total storage space.***

***The initial database operations (import and indexing) are intensive and can take up to **30 minutes** on a high-performance computer. **We have not tested the setup on configurations with less than 64 GB of RAM, and we strongly recommend a minimum of 64 GB of RAM** for running the application and its associated models efficiently.***

***For reference, with our specific high-end configuration (Ryzen 9 9950x3d, 192 GB RAM, and an RTX 5080), the complete application startup time, including all database processing, is approximately **15 minutes**.***

To ensure all large files are downloaded correctly, you must have Git Large File Storage (LFS) installed.

1. Prerequisites: Install Git LFS

Install Git LFS and initialize it:

```bash
git lfs install
```

2. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/NZ-Azurea/Project_steam.git
cd Project_steam
```

Execution via Docker (Recommended Method)

This method uses docker compose to build and run the application in a single step.

1. Build the Container

Build the Docker image.

``` bash
docker compose build --no-cache
```

2. Launch the Application

``` bash
docker compose up -d
```

Manual Execution (Troubleshooting)

If running via docker compose up encounters issues or to retrain the models.

1. Access the Container

Enter the Bash shell of the application container:

``` bash
docker exec -it steam_app bash
```

2. Run the Application

Once inside the container, grant execution rights and run the application with Uvicorn:

``` bash
chmod +x /start.sh
uv run uvicorn start.sh
```

To see the result. Go to your web-browser and write:

```bash
http://localhost:8501/
```


Local Development Setup (Without Docker)

***Warning: This setup is generally NOT RECOMMENDED for production and is provided for development or debugging purposes only. Use the Docker setup for the most stable and reproducible environment.***

To run the application directly on your host machine (as demonstrated by the `./start.sh` or `start.bat` script), you must manually ensure that all external dependencies and services are running and accessible.

You need the following prerequisites installed and running on your system:

  * **UV (Python Environment Manager)**
      * You need the **`uv`** tool (used for environment and dependency management).
  * **MongoDB Instance with autentification**
      * A local **MongoDB database instance** must be installed and running (accessible, typically on `localhost:27017`). The application relies on it for data persistence.
  * **LLAMA-Server**
      * The **LLAMA-Server** must be compiled and exposed. This server is necessary to run the machine learning models (like NLGCL or GenSar) used by the API.

You also need to create the .venv  of python 3.13.7 and dowload the libraries:

For example Linux:

```bash
uv venv .venv -p cpython-3.13.7-linux-x86_64-gnu
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For example windows:

```bash
uv venv .venv -p cpython-3.13.7-windows-x86_64-none
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For other instance please refert to uv [documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

Once these prerequisites are met, you can use the project's bootstrap script to finish the setup:

On Linux:

```bash
./start.sh
```

On Windows:

```bash
start.bat
```
